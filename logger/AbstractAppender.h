//! The AbstractAppender class provides an abstract base class for writing a log entries.
/**
 * The AbstractAppender class is the base interface class for all log appenders that could be used with Logger.
 *
 * AbstractAppender provides a common implementation for the thread safe, mutex-protected logging of application
 * messages, such as ConsoleAppender, FileAppender or something else. AbstractAppender is abstract and can not be
 * instantiated, but you can use any of its subclasses or create a custom log appender at your choice.
 *
 * Appenders are the logical devices that is aimed to be attached to Logger object by calling
 * Logger::registerAppender(). On each log record call from the application Logger object sequentially calls write()
 * function on all the appenders registered in it.
 *
 * You can subclass AbstractAppender to implement a logging target of any kind you like. It may be the external logging
 * subsystem (for example, syslog in *nix), XML file, SQL database entries, D-Bus messages or anything else you can
 * imagine.
 *
 * For the simple non-structured plain text logging (for example, to a plain text file or to the console output) you may
 * like to subclass the AbstractStringAppender instead of AbstractAppender, which will give you a more convinient way to
 * control the format of the log output.
 *
